        imagine that you have won a $100 gift certificate in a contest. You must spend
        the money in a particular store, but you can buy at most only three items.
        The storeâ€™s computer tracks the amount of money you have left to spend as
        well as the number of items you have bought. Each time you choose an item,
        the computer will tell you whether you can buy it. Although we have chosen
        small numbers for our example, we want to write a program for the computer

        buy are easily changed.
